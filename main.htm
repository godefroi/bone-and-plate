			We used to have the &quot;Doods&quot; describe this website in
			their own words- but it didn't work very well.&nbsp; However, they have decided
			to try and now IPO &quot;BDPD INC&quot;.&nbsp; Because of the success of their
			new found venture, Mr Ratbasterd - the doods lawyer - is here to say a few
			words.&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p style="text-align: left;">
			&quot;Welcome to Bonedood and Platedewds website.&nbsp; This,
			the corporate presence of BDPD Inc, is now the trademarked, registered and
			watermarked official site.&nbsp; Any reference to &quot;Dood&quot; or
			&quot;Bonehead&quot; must be obtained primarily in writing at least 6 months in
			advance from BDPD Inc.&nbsp; All properties of this website were truly obtained
			through legal and justifiable means.&nbsp; My clients, Mr Bonedood and Mr
			Platedewd are hereby ready to defend any previous actions that might have been
			performed in the past as &quot;PaRT of Da GamE&quot; and they rigorously deny
			any accusation that they were at all implied in any misdeed to any other member
			of Ultima Online.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p style="text-align: left;">
			Ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p style="text-align: left;">
			Oh, and please don't forget to purchase the new Bonedood and
			Platedewd Action figures.&quot; - Clarence P Ratbasterd
